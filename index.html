    <h1>Microsoft Edge as my main browser</h1>
    <img src="img/microsoftedgenewlogo.jpg" alt="Microsoft Edge logo" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
    <p>
        As my main browser I am using Microsoft Edge, the main reason for this is, because to <br />
        integration in windows, password, end multiple accounts. This way i have my <br />favorites, passwords etc. separated for private stuff, school and work. <br>
        <br>
        Altough in the past my favorite browser was firefox for a very long time. But  the last few years i experienced some <br>
        problems with websites not working properly and i was forced to change my browser for several websites.
